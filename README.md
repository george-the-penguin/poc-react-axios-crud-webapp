# poc-react-axios-crud-webapp

Proof of concept for a React CRUD webapp using Axios.

The application is based on the API REACT backend project created by the Team 10 of the Try-Catch initiative. The repository of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Trycatch-tv/f1it2-Team-10-Backend).

The application manages a set of appointments. The user can create, read, update and delete appointments.
